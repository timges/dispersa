## The Problem

Without a shared system, design decisions scatter across platforms. A brand blue becomes `#0066CC` in CSS, `UIColor(red: 0, green: 0.4, blue: 0.8)` in Swift, and `Color(0xFF0066CC)` in Kotlin. When the brand changes, you hunt through every file to update values. Theme variants multiply the work.

## What Is a Design Token?

A **design token** is a named, platform-agnostic design decision. Instead of hardcoding hex codes or pixel values, you define tokens like `color.brand.primary` or `spacing.md` in a single source. Tools then translate them into the format each platform needs—CSS custom properties, Swift constants, Kotlin resources, and more.

## Why Tokens Matter

- **Single source of truth** — Change one token, and all outputs update
- **Consistency** — Same names and values across web, iOS, Android, and other platforms
- **Scalability** — Add themes and modes by swapping token sets instead of editing hundreds of files
- **Theming** — Light, dark, and custom themes become manageable layers of overrides

## The DTCG Standard

The [Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG)](https://designtokens.org/) maintains an open specification that defines how tokens are structured and referenced. The [2025.10 standard](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/) is composed of three modules: the [Format Module](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/format/) (token structure, types, groups, and references), the [Color Module](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/color/) (color spaces and color token values), and the [Resolver Module](https://www.designtokens.org/TR/2025.10/resolver/) (assembling token sets with sets, modifiers, and resolution order). Dispersa implements this specification so your tokens stay portable and standards-compliant.

## Without Tokens vs. With Tokens

**Without tokens:** Values are duplicated across CSS, Swift, Kotlin, and design tools. A color update means manual edits in many places.

**With tokens:** One token file defines the design system. A build step resolves tokens and outputs the right format for each platform. Update a token once, rebuild, and all platforms stay in sync.
